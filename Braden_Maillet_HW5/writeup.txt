Errors: I now realise that I forgot to implement the program in such a way that the required function
takes the location to store the sum from the stack. This is the only error that I am aware of and
I don't really have the time to fix it so I hope it doesn't cost too many points.

Description: This program begins by requesting the user to input an integer for addition. It repeats
this for a second time. It then outputs a formatting sentence and outputs the sum of those two integers.
I set up the program so that it repeats this indefinetely. It uses the special IO memory location to
input and output characters. In order to convert the characters to decimal and vice versa, the program
uses division and multiplication that was created in the previous Homework.

Makefile notes: 
    'make obj' creates object file
    'make run' runs program
    'make clean' removes object file
